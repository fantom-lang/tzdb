# TZDB

This repo contains the IANA time zone database with corresponding modifications to enable it to work in the Fantom runtime. 
We maintain a copy of the original database in the `<version>-orig/` directory. The `<version>/` directory contains our
modifications for the Fantom time zone database.

Starting with the `2025c` release, you will find a `<version>/diffs/compare.txt` file that details the notable changes
between the current version and the previous version. This file is generated by the `./compare.fan` script.

To actually generate the time zone database for Fantom (JVM and JS runtimes), you need a Fantom distribution and
must run the `adm/buildtz.fan` script.  That script expects to find this repo in your `$HOME` directory so you
should clone this repo to your `$HOME` dir.
